# Heart-Disease-Predication-using-Machine-Learning
This project predicts whether a person is suffering from heart disease or not.
The project invloved the analysis of the dataset and model processing using different python libraries.
Different models were trained and predications are made using different Machine Learning algorithms like Logistic regression , K-Nearest Neighbours and Random Forest
I have implemented above algorithms using python programming in jupyter notebook.

Machine Learning algorithms used:

<br/>1.Logistic Regression (Scikit-learn)
<br/>2.K-Nearest Neighbours (Scikit-learn)
<br/>3.Random Forest (Scikit-learn)

Accuracy achieved: 88% (Logistic Regression)
